# Time-Breaker_ItcioJam
A game I made by myself for itchio Gamedev.js Jam 2023 without knowing anything about web game development. Hope you like it.

## How to play:
1. Clone the repository to a folder.
2. Open up a terminal in that folder.
3. Use `npx serve` to serve it locally.
4. Enjoy the game.

### My future plans for this project
In the future I will try to create this game with three.js because I really like it. By the time I hope I will improve myself in art, game design, sound design and of course in programming. I am planning to make it 3d the next time with a better quality. Hopefully I will push that in the feature in a new branch.

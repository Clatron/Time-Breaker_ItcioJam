# Time-Breaker_ItcioJam
A game I made by myself for itchio Gamedev.js Jam 2023 without knowing anything about web game development. Hope you like it.

## How to play:
1. Clone the repository to a folder.
2. Open up a terminal in that folder.
3. Use `npx serve` to serve it locally.
4. Enjoy the game.
